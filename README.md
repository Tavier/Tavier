- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tavier
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development (SQL, JavaScript, Python, and anything else I can get my hands on). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript through LaunchCode, and continuing my learning in SQL and Database Design - Normalization. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above. I'm always looking for ways to improve my life and others, so any knowledge you can drop me, please do!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
